# Linear regression and gradient descent with multiple variables

## Articles

Here are some good reads, before you get going.

[Read my medium article explaining the code](https://shaun-enslin.medium.com/gradient-descent-in-matlab-octave-954160e2d3fa)

[Site for great datasets](https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/10-open-datasets-for-linear-regression/)
